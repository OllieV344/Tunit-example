# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a simple .NET 9 project that demonstrates the key capabilities of TUnit, a modern testing framework for .NET. The project will showcase TUnit's features through practical examples including basic unit tests, parameterized tests, async testing, test lifecycle hooks, and advanced features like parallel execution and custom attributes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer learning TUnit, I want a working .NET 9 project with TUnit tests, so that I can see practical examples of how to use the framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN it SHALL be a valid .NET 9 console application
2. WHEN the project is built THEN it SHALL compile without errors
3. WHEN the solution is opened THEN it SHALL contain both a main project and a test project
4. WHEN dependencies are reviewed THEN the test project SHALL reference the latest stable TUnit packages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer exploring TUnit features, I want to see basic unit testing examples, so that I can understand fundamental TUnit syntax and assertions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN basic tests are executed THEN they SHALL demonstrate simple assertions using TUnit syntax
2. WHEN test methods are reviewed THEN they SHALL use TUnit attributes instead of traditional testing frameworks
3. WHEN assertions fail THEN they SHALL provide clear, readable error messages
4. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL execute successfully and show pass/fail results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with data-driven tests, I want to see parameterized test examples, so that I can learn how to run the same test with multiple input values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parameterized tests are executed THEN they SHALL run multiple times with different input values
2. WHEN test parameters are defined THEN they SHALL support various data types (strings, numbers, objects)
3. WHEN parameterized tests are reviewed THEN they SHALL demonstrate both inline parameters and method-sourced parameters
4. WHEN test results are displayed THEN each parameter combination SHALL be reported separately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with asynchronous code, I want to see async testing examples, so that I can understand how to test async methods with TUnit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN async tests are executed THEN they SHALL properly await asynchronous operations
2. WHEN async test methods are defined THEN they SHALL use proper async/await syntax with TUnit
3. WHEN async operations are tested THEN they SHALL handle both successful and exception scenarios
4. WHEN async tests complete THEN they SHALL report results correctly without hanging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer needing test setup and cleanup, I want to see test lifecycle examples, so that I can understand how to use setup and teardown methods in TUnit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test classes are executed THEN setup methods SHALL run before each test
2. WHEN test classes complete THEN cleanup methods SHALL run after each test
3. WHEN test lifecycle methods are defined THEN they SHALL use appropriate TUnit lifecycle attributes
4. WHEN multiple tests run THEN each SHALL have its own setup and cleanup execution

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer interested in advanced TUnit features, I want to see examples of parallel execution and custom attributes, so that I can understand TUnit's advanced capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are configured for parallel execution THEN they SHALL run concurrently where appropriate
2. WHEN custom test attributes are created THEN they SHALL extend TUnit's functionality
3. WHEN test categories or tags are used THEN they SHALL allow selective test execution
4. WHEN advanced features are demonstrated THEN they SHALL include practical, real-world scenarios

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer running the example project, I want clear documentation and instructions, so that I can understand how to build, run, and modify the examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is reviewed THEN it SHALL include a comprehensive README file
2. WHEN build instructions are followed THEN the project SHALL build successfully
3. WHEN test execution instructions are followed THEN all tests SHALL run and display results
4. WHEN code examples are reviewed THEN they SHALL include helpful comments explaining TUnit features
